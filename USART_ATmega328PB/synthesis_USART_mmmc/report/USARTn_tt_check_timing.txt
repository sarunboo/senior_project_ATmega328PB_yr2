Inputs without clocked external delays

The following primary inputs have no clocked external delays in mode            
'view_tt_v1p5_25c'.  As a result the timing paths leading from the ports have   
no timing constraints derived from clock waveforms.  The'external_delay'        
command is used to create new external delays.
