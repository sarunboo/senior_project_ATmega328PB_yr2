Timing exceptions with no effect

The following timing exceptions are not currently affecting timing in the       
design in mode 'view_ff_v1p32'.  Either no paths in the design satisfy the      
exception's path specification, or all paths that satisfy the path              
specification also satisfy an exception with a higher priority.  You can        
improve runtime and memory usage by removing these exceptions if they are not   
truly needed.  To see if there is a path in the design that satisfies the path  
specification for an exception, or to see what other exception is overriding an 
exception because of priority, use the command:                                 
  report timing -paths [eval [::legacy::get_attribute paths <exception>]]

Inputs without clocked external delays

The following primary inputs have no clocked external delays in mode            
'view_ff_v1p32'.  As a result the timing paths leading from the ports have no   
timing constraints derived from clock waveforms.  The'external_delay' command   
is used to create new external delays.
